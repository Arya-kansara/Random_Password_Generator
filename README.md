A Python-based security tool that generates strong, random passwords and securely saves them locally linked to specific application names.

## Key Features ##
1) Generates secure passwords using a mix of alphanumeric and special characters.
2) Automatically saves generated passwords to a local `.txt` file so users don't forget them.
3) Users can input the specific service (e.g., "Gmail", "Instagram") to label each password in the saved file.
